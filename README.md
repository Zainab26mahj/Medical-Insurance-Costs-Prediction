# Medical-Insurance-Costs-Prediction
This project predicts medical insurance costs using a linear regression model. Features like age, BMI, and smoking status are used after preprocessing (encoding, scaling). The model is evaluated with metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²), leveraging Python libraries like pandas and scikit-learn.
